"""Long-term memory: lasting facts about a farmer (their land, crops and
varieties, past problems, what they prefer), kept across conversations in the
LangGraph store (persistence.py, Postgres).

Memories live under ("memories", <phone>). The phone always comes from the
request's identity, never from the model, so a farmer's memories can only be
read or written in that farmer's own runs; auth.py applies the same rule to
the Agent Server's /store API.

The system prompt lists the farmer's memories every turn
(middlewares/system_prompt.py); fetch_user_memory is for searching them.
