"""Tracking a crop problem's treatment plan with the farmer, in a pane beside
the web chat (cases.py has the data and the rules).

Once a diagnosis is made and the farmer is going to treat it, the agent starts
a case: the plan as dated steps, from today to the last check. As the farmer
does steps and reports how the plants look, the agent records it, adjusts the
plan, and escalates to an officer when it is getting worse.

Each tool returns the case, as the web UI shows it, as the ToolMessage's
`artifact`, which the model never sees; the UI opens or refreshes the pane
from it. The model gets the plan in a compact form, with the ids it needs for
the next change.

A case belongs to the farmer (their phone), not to the thread: the system
prompt lists the open ones every turn, so the agent picks up where the farmer
left off in any conversation.

The store blocks, so these are sync tools: LangChain runs them in a thread.
