"""LangGraph persistence in Postgres (DB_URI):

- `checkpointer()`: conversation state (messages, tool results) per thread,
  so conversations survive restarts. Tables checkpoints*, made by setup().
- `store()`: long-term memory across conversations: what KrishiBondhu learned
  about a farmer (tools/memory.py), under the namespace ("memories", <phone>).
  Tables store*, made by setup().

langgraph.json points the Agent Server at both; main.py enters them too for
the plain /v1/chat routes. Each is an async context manager owning its own
connection pool, opened on the server's event loop.

These run as the login role, not krishi_app (db.py): the app role has no grant
on them. Who may read a thread or a namespace is enforced by auth.py.
