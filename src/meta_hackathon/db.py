"""Postgres (DB_URI): the app's own records and the reference data.

Every pooled connection runs as `krishi_app`, a role row-level security
applies to (the login role, avnadmin on Aiven, bypasses RLS). Policies on the
farmers' tables compare each row's phone with the `app.phone` setting:

- `farmer(phone)`: a transaction with `app.phone` set to the caller. A query
  can only ever see or write that farmer's rows, even one that forgets
  `WHERE phone = ...`. The setting is transaction-local, so a pooled
  connection goes back clean.
- `reference_rows(sql)`: lookups in the shared reference data (the `agri`
  schema: pesticide register, Krishoker Janala advice; the officer roster).
  `app.phone` is unset here, so no farmer's row is visible at all.

The schema is in sql/schema.sql; `krishi-db migrate` applies it, as the login
role (dbcli.py).

Calls block, so async code runs them with asyncio.to_thread: the Agent Server
rejects blocking calls on its event loop.
